End-to-end data analytics pipeline with Azure

# 🚀 Nexus DataLens – An End-to-End Data Engineering Project

> **Transforming raw data into meaningful insights – seamlessly, securely, and at scale.**

---

## ✨ About the Project
In today’s data-driven world, organizations need more than just storage – they need **pipelines** that *ingest, transform, and deliver insights* with minimal human effort.  

**Nexus DataLens** is my **M.Sc. (Information Technology) major project**, designed as a **cloud-native, end-to-end data pipeline** using **Microsoft Azure services**.  

The solution follows the **Bronze → Silver → Gold architecture** and demonstrates:
- Automated **data ingestion** from SQL Server
- **ETL transformations** in Databricks (PySpark)
- Secure **storage in Azure Data Lake Gen2**
- Unified **analytics with Synapse**
- Business-ready **dashboards with Power BI**

This project is not just academic—it’s a **blueprint for modern enterprises** seeking scalable, automated, and reliable data engineering.
